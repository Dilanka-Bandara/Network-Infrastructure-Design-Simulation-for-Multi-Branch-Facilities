# Network Infrastructure Design Simulation for Multi-Branch Facilities

## Project Overview
This project involves designing and simulating a scalable, secure network infrastructure for the Engineering Faculty at the University of Jaffna, which consists of five academic departments (Civil, Mechanical, EEE, Computer, and Interdisciplinary Studies) and an Administration section. The goal is to create a functional network that meets current needs while allowing for 30% future growth in each department.

## Key Features
- **Subnet Allocation**: Unique subnets for each department with calculated subnet masks, usable host ranges, and broadcast addresses.
- **VLAN Implementation**: Logical separation of network traffic for staff, students, and devices.
- **Device Categorization**: Separate networks for staff computers, student computers, printers, and specialized engineering equipment.
- **Central CCTV System**: Unified subnet for surveillance cameras across all departments.
- **Scalability**: Design accommodates future expansion with additional devices.

## Technical Components
- Subnet calculations for all departments and devices
- Network topology design with routers and switches
- VLAN configuration for logical network segmentation
- Inter-VLAN routing configuration
- Connectivity testing using ping and traceroute

## Deliverables
1. Subnet calculation tables
2. Network design diagram
3. Simulation files (Cisco Packet Tracer/GNS3)
4. Configuration scripts
5. Test reports with validation results

This project demonstrates practical application of network design principles, subnetting, VLAN implementation, and routing in a multi-department educational environment.
